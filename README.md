# Design and Implementation of a Blockchain Observatory for Cardano

Standards and cross-chain interoperability are currently missing in blockchain technology. 
Blockchain data analysis is more challenging as a result of this issue. 
This project aims to create a Blockchain Observatory, a platform for fast real-time analysis of blockchain data. 
We employ a use case based on the Cardano blockchain as a proof of concept and apply the project architecture to it. 
The framework's core comprises several cutting-edge and robust platforms, including Apache Spark for continuous, computationally intense investigations, MongoDB as a streaming storage layer, and Metabase for real-time visual analysis of such explorations. 
A state-of-the-art, interoperable system is integrated into the suggested architecture to manage massive data volumes and quick throughput. 
Expandability to various blockchains and other downstream analytical systems is its key objective.
We demonstrate how much processing power and storage the platform requires using the Cardano use case. 
We have developed an automatic update method that enables partial data processing, 
utilizing only the most recent data from the Cardano DB-sync node. 
This process would significantly reduce the memory and computation issue, 
obtaining lower execution time and computational resource savings. Lastly, it is crucial to comprehend that integrating a blockchain into an existing platform necessitates thoroughly examining the underlying data structure to modify data collection, stream processing, and analytical queries. Our practical case satisfies this requirement by analyzing the Cardano collections schema and building ad-hoc queries and related visualizations.
